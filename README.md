# Hi, I'm Elif 👋

### Senior Frontend & Full-Stack Engineer  
**Performance Engineering · Frontend Architecture · Production Ownership**

I specialize in **high-performance frontend systems** and production-grade web applications,  
with strong full-stack and infrastructure ownership. My work focuses on **Core Web Vitals**,  
**bundle optimization**, and **scalable frontend architectures** that perform reliably  
in real-world conditions.

## ⚡ What I Do

- Architect and optimize frontend applications with **React, Next.js, Vue, Nuxt.js**
- Lead **performance-critical refactors** in production  
  _(bundle size reduction, hydration cost, render scope, Web Vitals)_
- Design scalable backend services using **Node.js, TypeScript, Nest.js**
- Optimize performance-critical third-party and protocol-level dependencies,
balancing complex marketing, security, and Web3 integrations
without compromising runtime performance or user experience. 
  using centralized loading and async/deferred execution
- Deliver **measurable performance gains** with consistent high Lighthouse scores
- Operate secure, containerized production systems with **Docker, CI/CD, Linux, Nginx**

## 🧩 Frontend & Performance Philosophy

- Frontend performance is a **product feature**, not an afterthought
- Measure first, optimize second — **data-driven decisions**
- Prefer **lean client bundles** and deferred execution
- UX stability (CLS) and fast interaction matter more than feature count
